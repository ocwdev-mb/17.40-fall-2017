Van Evera, Stephen. ["Offense/Defense Theory in a Nutshell." (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlhW79Ah2I05ctRvkw8IcyvAtuKI8ZkA/view) August 27, 2017, revised March 7, 2018, pp. 1–11. 

_Your instructor's summary of the argument that states are more belligerent and war is more likely when conquest is easy. A key related argument: international conflict arises largely from the "security dilemma"-­ the tendency of states to threaten others' security by their efforts to secure themselves._

_Can the U.S. prevent war by making conquest hard in world trouble-spots? Have America's past conflict with others arisen from the security dilemma?_

Walt, Stephen M. "Explaining Alliance Formation." Chapter 2 in The _Origins of Alliances_. Cornell University Press, 1990. ISBN: 9780801494185. 

_Walt presents competing hypotheses on how states choose their friends. Which hypotheses are valid? Do your answers matter for the kind of foreign policy you would recommend?_

Beschloss, Michael R. "[Foreign Policy's Big Moment](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/11/opinion/foreign-policy-s-big-moment.html)," _New York Times_, April 11, 1999.

_Claimed here: during political campaigns U.S. politicians pander to U.S. voters by framing dangerous foreign policy positions that they cannot abandon once in office. The country is thereby led into folly. A corollary: a prime threat to America is … an American public that responds well to irresponsible pandering._

Kristof, Nicholas D. "[Save Our Spooks](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/30/opinion/save-our-spooks.html)," _New York Times_, May 30, 2003.

_Governments misperceive the world if their intelligence agencies misreport foreign realities. This can happen if government leaders press their intelligence agencies to tell the leaders what they want to hear regardless of the facts._

Jervis, Robert. "Deterrence, the Spiral Model, and Intentions of the Adversary." Chapter 3 in _Perception and Misperception in International Politics._ Princeton University Press, 2017, pp. 58–84. ISBN: 9780691175850. 

_Some ("spiral model" advocates) say international conflict is best resolved by the carrot, while using the stick merely provokes; others ("deterrence" advocates) would use the stick, warning that offering carrots ("appeasement") leads others to make more demands. Who's right? Probably both--but under what circumstances? And how can you tell which circumstances you face?_

Gilbert, Daniel. "[He Who Cast the First Stone Probably Didn't](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/opinion/24gilbert.html)," _New York Times_, July 24, 2006.

_Why do spirals happen? Gilbert describes research noting that people underestimate their own aggressive conduct and exaggerate others' aggressive conduct. This makes for conflict spirals._

Isaacson, Walter, and Evan Thomas. "A Pretty Good Club / Kennan and Bohlen in the Foreign Service." Chapter 5 in _The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made._ Simon and Schuster, 2013, pp. 171–73. ISBN: 9781476728827. 

———. ""Legacy / 'Never in such good company'." Chapter 24 in _The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made_. Simon and Schuster, 2013, pp. 731–33. ISBN: 9781476728827. 

_Does the American foreign policy elite share America's wider democratic values? We learn here that George Kennan thought women, blacks, and immigrants should be denied the vote; Kennan and Dean Acheson saw little wrong with the white minority governments in Rhodesia and South Africa; and John McCloy adopted the cause of Iran's Pahlevi family. Not your typical League of Women Voters views._

Hersh, Seymour M. "Intrigues." Chapter 9 in _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House._ Summit Books, 1983, pp. 108–11. ISBN: 9780671447601. 

_What to make of the attitudes of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and Alexander Haig reported here? (Are such attitudes widespread among foreign policymakers? Do such attitudes matter?)_

Cohen, Patricia. "[Great Caesar's Ghost! Are Traditional History Courses Vanishing?](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/books/11hist.html)," _New York Times,_ June 10, 2009.

_The study of political, diplomatic and military history is being marginalized or destroyed in American universities. Some find this dangerous. Will an increasingly ignorant American public will choose unwisely on fateful security matters? As Santayana warned: "Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it."_

Just, Marion, and Tom Rosenstiel. "[All the News That's Fed](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/26/opinion/all-the-news-thats-fed.html)," _New York Times,_ March 26, 2005.

_Television runs press-release videos handed them by powerful interests in order to save money and thicken the bottom line. TV is a business. It helps those who help it cut costs. Keeping you informed is not its purpose._

Jordan, Eason. "[The News We Kept To Ourselves](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/opinion/the-news-we-kept-to-ourselves.html)," _New York Times,_ April 11, 2003.

_The press can be cowed into practicing self-censorship. This allows tyrants to intimidate the press into painting themselves in rose­ colored hues._

Newhouse, John. "[Diplomacy, Inc.: The Influence of Lobbies on U.S. Foreign Policy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2009-05-01/diplomacy-inc)." _Foreign Affairs_, May / June 2009.

_Unlike other major powers the United States allows foreign lobbies free run of its national capitol. These foreign lobbies have large influence on US foreign policy. Is this a good idea? Do foreigners have Americans' best interests at heart? The answer is no._

Massing, Michael. "[The Storm Over the Israel Lobby](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2006/06/08/the-storm-over-the-israel-lobby/)." _New York Review of Books,_ June 8, 2006.

_An Israel lobby has strong influence over U.S. foreign policy toward the Mideast--but less influence than some (John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt) have argued._

Guttman, Nathan. "[Pro-Israel Christians Mobilize in D.C.](https://forward.com/news/11191/pro-israel-christians-mobilize-in-dc-00168/)" _Jewish Daily Forward_, July 18, 2007.

_A major faction of evangelical Christians lobby hard to prevent U.S. support for any land-for-peace settlement between Israel and its neighbors. These Christians are an important element of the Israel lobby._

### _Cold War-era (1947–89) national security strategy ideas_

\[G\] Chapter 1: Prologue: Containment Before Kennan.

\[G\] Chapter 2: George F. Kennan and the Strategy of Containment.

_In Chapter 2, Gaddis explicates his ideas._

### _George W. Bush-era (2001–09) national security strategy ideas, debates_

Sanger, David E. "[Bush to Formalize A Defense Policy of Hitting First](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/17/world/bush-to-formalize-a-defense-policy-of-hitting-first.html)," _New York Times,_ June 17, 2002.

_The George W. Bush Administration embraced a general doctrine of preventive war against rogue states that aspire to develop weapons of mass destruction. Iraq was the first rogue state on its hit list: Syria and Iran were also high on the list; Libya and Saudi Arabia were further down. Are such preventive wars a good idea?_

Lieber, Keir A. and Robert J. Lieber. ["The Bush National Security Strategy." (PDF)](https://usiraq.procon.org/sourcefiles/2002USNSS-A_New_Era.pdf) _U.S. Foreign Policy Agenda, An Electronic Journal of the U.S. Department of State_ 7, no. 4 (December 2002): 32–35.

_A friendly summary and assessment of the_ [_2002 National Security Strategy of the United States of America (PDF)_](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/63562.pdf) _(Washington D.C.: White House, September 2002), (NSS), the document that frames the main elements of the George W. Bush administration strategy, including its general doctrine of preventive war (see Sanger article above)._

Baker, Kevin. "[American Imperialism, Embraced](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/09/magazine/the-year-in-ideas-a-to-z-american-imperialism-embraced.html)," _New York Times Magazine,_ December 9, 2001.

Ricks, Thomas E. "[Empire or Not? A Quiet Debate Over U.S. Role](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/08/21/empire-or-not-a-quiet-debate-over-us-role/d57204a6-d3b9-4330-b1ce-44e8bdd5b410/?utm_term=.e330d24bf993)," _Washington Post,_ August 21, 2001.

_After 2000, important elements of the U.S. conservative movement began arguing for a U.S. empire. Do Tom Donnelly and William Kristal have a good idea?_

### _Obama-era (2009–17) national security strategy ideas, debates:_

Sanger, David E., and Peter Baker. "[New U.S. Strategy Focuses on Managing Threats](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/world/28strategy.html)," _New York Times,_ May 27, 2010.

_The Obama administration national security strategy dropped the George W. Bush administration's unilateralist approach in favor of pursuing common action, and it downgraded the Bush emphasis on preventive war. It focused on preventing terror, limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and halting climate change._

### _Trump-era (2017–) national security strategy ideas, debates_

Kahl, Colin, and Hal Brands. "[Trump's Grand Strategic Train Wreck: Believe It or Not, the President has a Grand Strategy. But it's a Nightmarish Mess](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/31/trumps-grand-strategic-train-wreck/)." _Foreign Policy,_ January 31, 2017.

_Please read only the first half of this essay, roughly pages 1–7, up to the section heading reading "Trump's Grand Strategic Dilemmas." The Trump administration sees three overriding threats to the U.S.: radical Islam, unfair trade deals (especially with China), and illegal immigration. The administration offers four strategies to address these threats: extreme homeland security measures, trade protectionism, alliances with dictators like Russia's Putin while downgrading U.S. democratic allies (NATO states) and coercing these allies to contribute more military power, and heavy reliance on the use of force as a policy tool. Trump's focus on the radical Islam threat echoes Bush 43 and Obama; other focuses are new._

Sanger, David E. "[Talk of 'Preventive War' Rises in White House Over North Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/world/asia/north-korea-war-trump.html)," _New York Times,_ August 20, 2017.

_Preventive war is back! Unlike Obama officials, some Trump officials think that North Korea cannot be deterred or contained in the way the Soviet Union and China were deterred and contained; and that military action to destroy North Korea's nuclear forces is feasible at acceptable cost. Hence these Trump officials think the U.S. should launch preventive war against North Korea._

versus

Rice, Susan E. "[It's Not Too Late on North Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/opinion/susan-rice-trump-north-korea.html)," _New York Times_, August 10, 2017.

_Rice argues that preventive war against North Korea would be very costly, and would risk war with China. Moreover, North Korea can be deterred and contained, and eventually persuaded to halt its nuclear program, by economic sanction and carrots. Preventive war "would be lunacy."_

### _National security strategies from academe_

Dizikes, Peter. "[Time to Rethink Foreign Policy?](http://news.mit.edu/2014/rethink-foreign-policy-0709)" MIT News, July 9, 2014.

_Political scientist and MIT professor_ [_Barry Posen_](https://polisci.mit.edu/people/barry-r-posen) _argues for a more limited U.S. grand strategy in an important book,_ Restraint: A New Foundation for U.S. Grand Strategy. _Cornell University Press, 2015. ISBN: 9781501700729. \[Preview with_ [_Google Books_](https://books.google.com/books?id=rnmuAwAAQBAJ&pg=PAfrontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)_\] The U.S. should prevent any state from dominating industrial Eurasia, but that's an easy task--there is no candidate for Eurasian hegemony today. The U.S. should also work to limit nuclear proliferation and to destroy terrorist groups that aim to harm the U.S., but that's easy too. It doesn't require a wide U.S. empire and is best achieved by largely nonmilitary means. Invading Iraq was a bad idea: avoid similar projects down the road._

 Van Evera, Stephen, ed. ["American Foreign Policy for the New Era." (PDF)](https://tobinproject.org/sites/tobinproject.org/files/assets/Make_America_Safe_American_Foreign_Policy_For_New_Era.pdf) In _How to Make America Safe: New Policies for National Security._ Tobin Project, 2006. 

_The U.S. should lead in forming a concert of major powers to address the prime threats to the U.S.: the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), terrorists like al-Qaeda who would use WMD against the U.S.; and climate change. Imperial conduct by the U.S. would preclude such a concert and should therefore be eschewed._

### _Protecting the commons: climate change_

Frank, Robert H. "[A Small Price for a Large Benefit](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/business/economy/21view.html)," _New York Times,_ February 21, 2010.

_Climate change is real and dangerous. We face a 10 percent chance of a catastrophic 12-degree climb in temperatures by 2100. And: we can prevent catastrophic climate change at modest cost. Maybe we should do it!_

Homer-Dixon, Thomas. "[Terror in the Weather Forecast](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/opinion/24homer-dixon.html)," _New York Times,_ April 24, 2007.

_Climate change will cause failed states, terrorism, and vast forced migrations, triggering civil and international war. How cheery._

Davenport, Coral. "[Climate Change Deemed Growing Security Threat by Military Researchers](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/us/politics/climate-change-deemed-growing-security-threat-by-military-researchers.html),'' _New York Times,_ May 14, 2014.

[_The Center for Naval Analyses_](https://www.cna.org/centers/cna/) _warns that climate change will disrupt other societies in ways that will cause conflict, war, refugees, and chaos overseas, and will do damage to U.S. military infrastructure in the U.S. U.S. national security will suffer._

Romm, Joe. "[Climate Panel Stunner: Avoiding Climate Catastrophe is Super Cheap-But Only if We Act Now](https://thinkprogress.org/climate-panel-stunner-avoiding-climate-catastrophe-is-super-cheap-but-only-if-we-act-now-48da9b59e02b/)." ThinkProgress, April 13, 2014.

_Action to contain climate change would not cost much. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can be kept below 450 parts per million (a commonly accepted target) in 2100 by actions that would only shave a trivial .06 percent off the U.S. economic growth rate if we began now. Chump change! But delay will sharply raise the costs of effective action._

### _Humanitarian intervention, debates about it_

Kaufmann, Chaim. "[See No Evil: Why America Doesn't Stop Genocide](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2002-07-01/see-no-evil-why-america-doesnt-stop-genocide)." _Foreign Affairs,_ July / August 2002.

_The U.S. could have stopped genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and elsewhere but chose not to. Good choice? Should the U.S. intervene to prevent such horrors?_

Cooper, Glenda. "U.S. Memos on Rwanda Cited," _Boston Globe,_ August 23, 2001.

_More color on U.S. inaction in Rwanda._

Kristof, Nicholas "[Yet Again in Sudan](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/opinion/30kristof.html)," _New York Times,_ June 29, 2011.

_The ever-murderous Islamist government of Sudan conducted a 55-year killing spree against its own people, killing 1–2 million people in now­ independent South Sudan, then 300,000 in Darfur, then the Nuba people. Should something have been done?_

Kinzer, Stephen. "[Are Human Rights Activists Today's Warmongers?](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/05/24/are-human-rights-activists-today-warmongers/gef04rpPxgEdCEdx4DQ87J/story.html)" _Boston Globe,_ May 25, 2014.

_Claimed by Kinzer: Human rights advocates now often call for war to protect human rights, e.g., in Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, This is unwise._ [_Human Rights Watch_](https://www.hrw.org/) _has been captured by advocates of a belligerent parochial agenda. This is bad._

### _Protecting the commons: global public health_

Troedsson, Hans, and Anton Rychener, "[When Influenza Takes Flight](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/05/opinion/when-influenza-takes-flight.html)," _New York Times_, February 5, 2005.

_The 1918 flu killed 675,000 Americans--more than died in combat in the two World Wars combined. Bummer. Something similar could happen again. We have learned some tricks since 1918 but remain poorly prepared for another lethal flu pandemic. What's the answer? Two ideas: better vaccine manufacturing technique, and worldwide preventive action. Again, everyone must cooperate. Hence this is a foreign policy problem. What are we doing about it? Not much._

### _Spreading democracy: a debated goal_

Kinzer, Stephen. "[Stability Does Not Require Democracy](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/08/17/stability-does-not-require-democracy/mOUHg9onjzQGb5UvoN8vKO/story.html)," _Boston Globe,_ August 17, 2014.

_Kinzer argues that the U.S. should not reflexively favor ousting authoritarian regimes. Often democracy won't result; and sometimes what follows will be worse. Witness Iraq 2003, Libya 2011. Regime change is difficult business. The US track record at regime change is very spotty._

_The advance of science has a fearsome byproduct: we are discovering ever more powerful means of destruction. These destructive powers are being democratized: the mayhem that only major states can do today may lie within the capacity of millions of individuals in the future unless we somehow change course. Deterrence works against states but will fail against crazed non-state organizations or individuals. How can the spread of destructive powers be controlled?_

[_Controlling Dangerous Pathegens: A Prototype Protective Oversight System._](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/7949) [(PDF - 3.0MB)](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/7949) The Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland.

Kelly, Henry C. "[Terrorism and the Biology Lab](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/02/opinion/terrorism-and-the-biology-lab.html)," _New York Times_, July 2, 2003.

_The biology profession must realize that its research, if left unregulated, could produce discoveries that gravely threaten our safety. Biologists must develop a strategy to keep biology from being used for destructive ends._

Regalado, Antonio. "[Top U.S. Intelligence Official Calls Gene Editing a WMD Threat](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600774/top-us-intelligence-official-calls-gene-editing-a-wmd-threat/)." _MIT_ _Technology Review,_ February 9, 2016.

_The wolf that worried Henry Kelly--new ultra­ lethal biotechnology (see previous reading)--is at our door. Recent advances in gene editing, embodied in the CRISPR editing method, will spread the power to create new bioagents hither and yon, including to nihilistic terrorists and psychopaths. They will not be deterrable. The only way to reliably prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is deterrence, but these bad actors are not deterrable. U.S. director of national intelligence James Clapper warned of this danger in 2016, declaring CRISPR--a product of the U.S. scientific community--to be a threat to U.S. national security. Has our bioengineering science community created a grave threat?_

Whitman, Christine Todd. "[The Chemical Threat to America](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/opinion/the-epa-can-fix-the-chemical-flaw.html)," _New York Times,_ August 30, 2012.

_A clever attack on a chemical plant in the U.S. could cause vastly greater mayhem than the 9/11/01 attack. But little has been done to secure U.S. chemical plants from attack. Earth to Washington: maybe do something?_

Allison, Graham. "[Living in the Era of Megaterror](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/opinion/living-in-the-era-of-megaterror.html)," _New York Times,_ September 7, 2012.

_Al-Qaeda has been weakened by U.S. attacks on its leadership and infrastructure, and by its self­ delegitimating conduct. But over the longer term the threat of WMD terror will rise as the advance of science disperses the capacity to commit mass killing to more groups and individuals._

_General Electric and Hitachi have reportedly developed a new means to enrich uranium. Enriching uranium is the key step in making an atomic bomb. The GE/Hitachi Silex process allows enrichment in a small, low-cost facility. Will this put atomic bombs in close reach of crazy states and terrorists? Is Rees's nightmare coming true? Have the people at GE and Hitachi taken leave of their senses? Inquiring minds want to know._

_Is history written to emphasize the uses of force by Presidents, and to downplay their horse trading and compromise? The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was settled by concessions from both sides, although Kennedy hid the U.S. concessions from public view and painted the outcome as a pure Soviet backdown. Smith notes that other war-hero presidents, including Grant and Eisenhower, eschewed force and cut deals at important moments, and more often than popular history remembers. U.S. Grant was a peacenick! George Washington stood against strong hawkish criticism to reach Jay's treaty, which avoided war with Britain. John Adams resisted strong demands for war with France, losing office as a result. But their policies look good in retrospect._

_North Korea's government prefers conflict over harmony with others. It has so provoked its neighbors that it now thinks it must have nuclear weapons to be safe from them. Its military strategy features hair-trigger escalation to nuclear war at the outset of any confrontation. It has a very high threshold for the pain that economic sanctions inflict. Its nuclear weapons are now too numerous and well-hidden to be destroyed before they could be launched, so a preemptive attack on North Korea would likely involve very high costs. It will demand extravagant U.S. concessions in exchange for any deal. In short North Korea is the adversary from hell._
